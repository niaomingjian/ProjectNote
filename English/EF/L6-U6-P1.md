Jake - Well, I was drinking some red grape juice, just standing on your white carpet.  
Sally- Okay, salt. We need salt. Salt will take out the grape juice.  
Jake - I can't tell you how sorry I am. I'm so embrassed.  
Sally- It's going to be OK. Don't worry. That's fine.  
Pam  - Hi, Sally. Jake ruined our carpet.
