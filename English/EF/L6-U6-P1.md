Todd - Good Evening.  
Sally- Todd, you made it.  
Sally- Welcome.  
Todd - Thanks.  
Sally- Can I take your coat?  
Todd - Thanks. Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.  
Sally- Where is Angela?  
Todd - Oh, I'm really sorry. But Angela had to go to dinner with her boss and a client tonight.  
Sally- Oh, That's too bad.  
Todd - Yeah. It came up at the last minute. I was gonna call, but...  
Sally- I completely understand. Really, it's fine.  
Todd - Angela wanted me to apologize for her.  
Sally- They're lovely.  
Harry- Sally, Would you mind if I went out on your balcony and smoked a cigarette?  
Sally- No, not at all. My cousin Pete's probably already there with his cigar. Just introduce yourself to him. Â 
Harry- Thanks.  
Todd - Um, Could you remind me where the bathroom is?  
Sally- Of course. Straight ahead, then take a right.  
Todd - OKay.  
Jake - Sally, you're gonna kill me.  
Sally- What have you done this time.  
Jake - Well, I was drinking some red grape juice and standing on your white carpet.  
Sally- Okay. Salt. We need salt. Salt will take out the grape juice.  
Jake - I can't tell you how sorry I am. I'm so embarrassed.  
Sally- Jake, it's going to be OK. Don't worry. It's fine.  
Pam  - Hey, Sally. Jake's ruined our carpet.  
Simon- It's not ruined, Pam. It just needs some salt and stuff. Come on.
